Generates HTML pages of API documentation from Java source files.

Synopsis
javadoc {packages|source-files} [options] [@argfiles]

packages
Names of packages that you want to document, separated by spaces, for example java.lang java.lang.reflect java.awt. If you want to also document the subpackages, use the -subpackages option to specify the packages.

By default, javadoc looks for the specified packages in the current directory and subdirectories. Use the -sourcepath option to specify the list of directories where to look for packages.

source-files
Names of Java source files that you want to document, separated by spaces, for example Class.java Object.java Button.java. By default, javadoc looks for the specified classes in the current directory. However, you can specify the full path to the class file and use wildcard characters, for example /home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java.
